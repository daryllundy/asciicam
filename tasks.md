### Notes
- Tasks are organized by priority and logical implementation order
- Each phase can be tackled independently
- Some tasks may require research or additional dependencies
- Consider your time constraints and focus on high-priority items first

### Claude Code Usage Tips
1. Use `claude code` to implement specific tasks
2. Ask for code reviews after implementing major changes
3. Request help with testing strategies and implementations
4. Get assistance with CI/CD pipeline configurations
5. Ask for help with documentation and README improvements
